  @KFSQA-860 @PREQ @Routing @tortoise
  Scenario: Requisition under dollar threshold Requiring Award Review
    Given I login as a KFS user to create an REQS
    And   I create the Requisition document with an Award Account and items that total less than the dollar threshold Requiring Award Review
    And   I submit the Requisition document
    When  I route the Requisition document to final
    Then  Award Review is not in the Requisition document workflow history

  Scenario: Financial Officer can add other accounts to REQ and document route to another FO - Implement KFSMI-8165 Test 1
  Given I submit a Requisition document with the following:
    | Vendor Type        | NonB2B    |
    | Add Vendor On REQS | Yes       |
    | Positive Approval  | Unchecked |
    | Account Type       | NonGrant  |
    | Commodity Code     | Regular   |
    | Amount             | GT APO    |
    And  I view the Requisition document from the Requisitions search
    And  I switch to the user with the next Pending Action in the Route Log for the Requisition document
    And  I view the Requisition document on my action list
    And  I set the added account percent to 50
    And  I add these Accounting Lines to Item #1 on the Requisition document:
      | chart_code | account_number       | object_code | percent |
      | Default    | 1093603              | 6570        | 50     |
    And  I calculate my Requisition document
    And  I approve the Requisition document
    And  I view the Requisition document from the Requisitions search
    Then the next pending action for the Requisition document is an IN ACTION LIST from a  KFS-SYS Accounting Reviewer
