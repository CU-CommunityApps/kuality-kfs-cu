Feature: Requisition routing testing

  [KFSQA-1174] Verify a Requisition containing a sensitive or non-sensitive commodity code routes appropriately for review

  @KFSQA-1174 @REQS @Routing @solid @coral
  Scenario Outline: Verify a Requisition containing a sensitive or non-sensitive commodity code routes appropriately for review
    Given I am logged in as a KFS User for the REQS document
    And I create a Requisition with required Delivery and Additional Institutional information populated
    And I add an Item with a unit cost of 1 to the Requisition with a <commodity_code_type> Commodity Code
    And I add an Accounting Line to or update the favorite account specified for the Requisition Item just created
    And I calculate the Requisition document
    And I submit the Requisition document
    And the Requisition document goes to ENROUTE
    And I switch to the user with the next Pending Action in the Route Log for the Requisition document
    And I display the Requisition document
    Then a Commodity Reviewer does <existence_check> a Pending or Future Action approval request for the <commodity_code_type> Commodity Code
    Examples:
      | commodity_code_type | existence_check |
      | sensitive           | have            |
      | non-sensitive       | not have        |

#  [KFSQA-865] KITI-763	KFSUPGRADE-409 PUR-2 Shop Catalogs Routing Changes - split node routing per csu	Purchasing	SciQuest PO Routing	PURAP 001 E2E
#  This fix is necessary to allow the e-shop orders under 500 or 1500 depending on role to be sent without FO approval on the PO, and later to require approval on PREQ

#  Scenario Outline: EShop routing verification with total cost between B2B_TOTAL_AMOUNT_FOR_AUTO_PO and B2B_TOTAL_AMOUNT_FOR_SUPER_USER_AUTO_PO
#    Given  I create an e-SHOP Requisition document with a <item type> item type
#    Then   the Requisition document does not route to the Financial Officer
#    When   I route the e-SHOP Requisition document through SciQuest until the Payment Request document is ENROUTE
#    Then   the next pending action for the Payment Request document is an APPROVE from a  KFS-SYS Fiscal Officer IT
#  Examples:
#          | item type     |
#          | Non-Sensitive |
#          | Sensitive     |

#  Scenario Outline: Create ESHOP order 500 and one for 1500
#    Given  I create an e-SHOP Requisition document with a <item type> item type that is at least <cart value> in value
#    Then   the Requisition document does not route to the Financial Officer
#    When   I route the e-SHOP Requisition document through SciQuest until the Payment Request document is ENROUTE
#    Then   the next pending action for the Payment Request document is an APPROVE from a  KFS-SYS Fiscal Officer IT
#  Examples:
#           | item type     | cart value |
#           | Non-Sensitive |  501       |
#           | Non-Sensitive |  1501      |
#           | Sensitive     |  501       |
#           | Sensitive     |  1501      |
