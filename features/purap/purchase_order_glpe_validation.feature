  Scenario: Cancel a Purchase Order and verify the GLPE.
   Given  I login as a PURAP eSHop user
   And    I create the Requisition document with:
     | Vendor Number       | 4471-0   |
     | Item Quantity       | 9.9      |
     | Item Cost           | 1000     |
     | Item Commodity Code | 10121800 |
     | Account Number      | 1093603  |
     | Object Code         | 6540     |
     | Percent             | 100      |
#    Given I INITIATE A REQS with following:
#    And the Items are GT AUTOMATIC_PURCHASE_ORDER_DEFAULT_LIMIT_AMOUNT
    And I submit the Requisition document
    And I switch to the user with the next Pending Action in the Route Log for the Requisition document
    And I view the Requisition document on my action list
    And I approve the Requisition document
    And I am logged in as a Purchasing Processor
    And I submit a Contract Manager Assignment of '10' for the Requisition
#    And I am logged in as a KFS Fiscal Officer
    And I am logged in as "mss7"
    And I cancel the Purchase Order on the Requisition
    When I view the Requisition document
    Then On the Purchase Order the GLPE displays "There are currently no General Ledger Pending Entries associated with this Transaction Processing document."
