  [KFSQA-994] I CREATE A CAPITAL ASSET REQS E2E (Individual Assets/New)

  [KFSQA-995] Create a Capital Asset starting with Base Function attributes and change Asset to System Type of One System with a System State of New System. Take the asset from Requisition to APO to PREQ to CAB and to Payment.

  [KFSQA-997] First, create a initial Capital Asset with Base Function attributes. Second, create a modification to this asset. Keep the System Type
              of Individual Assets but with a System State of Modify Existing System. Retrieve the previously created asset for modification. Take
              the asset from Requisition to APO to PREQ to CAB and to Payment.
