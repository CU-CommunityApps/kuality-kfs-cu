  Scenario: Create and edit Contracts and Grants Reporting Code, assign it to an Object Code, then search for the Object Code using the Contracts and Grants Reporting Code.
    Given I am logged in as a KFS Contracts & Grants Manager
    When  I create a Contract Grant Reporting Code document
    And   I submit the Contract Grant Reporting Code document
    And   the Contract Grant Reporting Code document goes to FINAL
    And   I edit the CG Reporting Code Name of the Contract Grant Reporting Code
    And   I submit the Contract Grant Reporting Code document
    And   the Contract Grant Reporting Code document goes to FINAL
    And   I am logged in as a KFS User
    And   I search for the Contract Grant Reporting Code just entered
    Then  I should only see the Contract Grant Reporting Code just entered with its revised name
    And   I am logged in as a KFS Contracts & Grants Manager
    And   I change the Contract and Grant Reporting Code on a Contract and Grant Object Code to the Contract and Grant Reporting Code just entered
    And   I submit the Object Code document
    And   the Object Code document goes to ENROUTE
    And   I route the Object Code document to final
    And   I am logged in as a KFS User
    And   I search for an Object Code using the Contract Grant Reporting Code
    Then  I should only see the Object Code document with the searched for CG Reporting Code in the object code search results
