Feature: Pre-Encumbrance

  [KFSQA-654] Open Encumbrances Lookup not displaying pending entries generated from the PE eDoc.
  [KFSQA-739] Background: Cornell University needs to process pre-encumbrances with expense object
              codes and verify the Accounting Line persists to the GL
  [KFSQA-664] Cornell has modified KFS to allow for revenue object codes on the PE form. Allow revenue on Pre-Encumbrance.
  [KFSQA-753] Cornell University needs to process pre-encumbrances with expense
              object codes and verify proper offsets are used.
  [KFSQA-988] Submit a pre-encumbrance edoc to encumber and disencumber on the same document using an existing
              encumbrance to disencumber and create new encumbrance using fixed monthly schedule.
              Verify you must save edoc before submission to generate reversal dates, review scheduled reversal
              dates on pending entries tab before submitting, and perform lookup on open encumbrance screen to verify accuracy.
