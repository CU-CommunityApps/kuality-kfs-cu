  Scenario: Open Encumbrances Lookup will display pending entries from PE eDoc
    Given I am logged in as a KFS Chart Manager
    And   I clone a random Account with the following changes:
      | Name        | Test Account             |
      | Chart Code  | IT                       |
      | Description | [KFSQA-654] Test Account |
    Given I am logged in as a KFS Chart Administrator
    When  I blanket approve a Pre-Encumbrance Document that encumbers the random Account
    And   the Pre-Encumbrance document goes to FINAL
    And   I do an Open Encumbrances lookup for the Pre-Encumbrance document with Balance Type PE and Include All Pending Entries
    Then  the Lookup should return results

  Scenario: Process a Pre-Encumbrance using a revenue object code.
    Given   I am logged in as a KFS System Manager
    When    I update the OBJECT_TYPES Parameter for the Pre-Encumbrance component in the KFS-FP namespace with the following values:
      | Parameter Value | EX;IC |

    When    I lookup the Encumbrance Accounting Line for the Pre-Encumbrance document via Available Balances with these options selected:
      | Include Pending Ledger Entry | All |
    And     I open the Encumbrance Amount General Ledger Balance Lookup in the Available Balances lookup that matches the one submitted for Encumbrance Accounting Line on the Pre-Encumbrance document
    And     I lookup all entries for the current month in the General Ledger Balance lookup entry
    Then    the General Ledger Balance lookup displays the document ID for the Pre-Encumbrance document
    And     the Encumbrance Accounting Line on the General Ledger Balance lookup for the Pre-Encumbrance document equals the displayed amounts
