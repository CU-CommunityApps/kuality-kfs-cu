  Scenario Outline: Recall enroute Documents
    Given  I am logged in as "<user>"
    #for all these eDocs
    And    I start an empty <eDoc> document
    And I add a source Accounting Line to the <eDoc> document with the following:
      | Chart Code   | IT |
      | Number       | <source_account> |
      | Object Code  | 6690 |
      | Amount       | <source_amount> |
    And I add a target Accounting Line to the <eDoc> document with the following:
      | Chart Code   | IT |
      | Number       | <target_account> |
      | Object Code  | 6690 |
      | Amount       | <target_amount> |
    And    I save the <eDoc> document
    And    I submit the <eDoc> document
    And    the <eDoc> document goes to ENROUTE
    When   I recall the financial document
    Then   the <eDoc> document goes to SAVED
