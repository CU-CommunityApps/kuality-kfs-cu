  [KFSQA-662] To properly control Labor Ledger entries, Cornell University modified the LLJV with approval node LLJVApproval. Cornell roles for Labor Distribution Manager (cu) will initiate the eDoc and LLJV Approver (cu) will approve it.

  @KFSQA-662 @hare @wip
  Scenario: Ensure the LLJVApproval node works.
    Given I am logged in as a KFS User for the LLJV document
    And   I submit a Labor Journal Voucher document
    And   I switch to the user with the next Pending Action in the Route Log for the Labor Journal Voucher document
    And   I view the Labor Journal Voucher document
    And   I approve the Labor Journal Voucher document
    And   the Labor Journal Voucher document goes to FINAL
