    Scenario: Creating a new vendor to test cornell specific mods, separation of duties, and vendor address and attachments persist.
      Given I am logged in as a Vendor Initiator
      When  I start a Purchase Order Vendor document with the following fields:
        | Description       | KFSQA-840 Testing   |
        | Vendor Type       | PO - PURCHASE ORDER |
        | Vendor First Name | First Name          |
        | Vendor Last Name  | Last Name           |
        | Vendor Name       | nil                 |
        | Foreign           | No                  |
        | Tax Number Type   | FEIN                |
        | Ownership         | CORPORATION         |
        | W9 Received       | Yes                 |
        | W9 Received Date  | tomorrow            |
      And   I note how many attachments the Vendor document has already
      And   I add an attachment to the Vendor document
      And   I submit the Vendor document
      Then  I should get an error saying "Date cannot be in the future"
      When  I change the Vendor document's W9 Received Date field to today
      And   I submit the Vendor document
      Then  the Vendor document goes to ENROUTE
      And   the initiator is not an approver in the Future Actions table
      Given I route the Vendor document to FINAL by clicking approve for each request
      And   I am logged in as a Vendor Initiator
      When  I view the Vendor document
      Then  the default Purchase Order Vendor address(es) are shown on the Vendor document
      And   the Vendor document's Notes and Attachments Tab has 1 more attachment than before
