Feature: Vendor Edit

  [KFSQA-755] I want to edit a vendor with ownership type INDIVIDUAL.

  [KFSQA-773] PO Vendor Edit, with Expired Insurance.
  
  [KFSQA-839] Cornell modified the routing of Vendor eDocs to always include a second review.
              Whenever Create-New or Lookup-Edit (Role CU Vendor Initiator) change a vendor
              record --- a second reviewer (assigned the role Vendor Reviewer Omit Initiator)
              needs to approve the eDoc. Additionally, Cornell has added roles to
              1) View attachments ---Vendor Attachment viewer (cu), and,
              2) Update the Contract Tab --- Vendor Contract Editor (cu).
              Moreover, Cornell added (as display on addresses) the KFS internal
              data element named Vendor Address Generated Identifier.
