Feature: Vendor Edit

  [KFSQA-755] I want to edit a vendor with ownership type INDIVIDUAL.

  [KFSQA-773] PO Vendor Edit, with Expired Insurance.
  
  [KFSQA-839] Cornell modified the routing of Vendor eDocs to always include a second review.
              Whenever Create-New or Lookup-Edit (Role CU Vendor Initiator) change a vendor
              record --- a second reviewer (assigned the role Vendor Reviewer Omit Initiator)
              needs to approve the eDoc. Additionally, Cornell has added roles to
              1) View attachments ---Vendor Attachment viewer (cu), and,
              2) Update the Contract Tab --- Vendor Contract Editor (cu).
              Moreover, Cornell added (as display on addresses) the KFS internal
              data element named Vendor Address Generated Identifier.

  Scenario: Edit a vendor and ensure routing to the second reviewer. Confirm display of Vendor Address Generated Identifier. Confirm previously added attachments persist.
    Given I am logged in as a Vendor Initiator
    And   I edit a PO Vendor
    When  I add a Supplier Diversity to the Vendor document
    And   I add a Search Alias to the Vendor document
    And   I note how many attachments the Vendor document has already
    And   I add an attachment to the Vendor document
    And   I submit the Vendor document
    Then  the next pending action for the Vendor document is an APPROVE from a KFS-VND Reviewer
    Given I route the Vendor document to final
    And   I am logged in as a Vendor Attachment viewer (cu)
    When  I open the Vendor from the Vendor document
    Then  the Address Tab displays Vendor Address Generated Identifiers for each Address
    And   the Vendor document's Notes Tab displays the added attachment
