Feature: Account Delegate Global

  [KFSQA-568]           As a KFS Chart Manager I want to cancel the Edit of an
                        Account Delegate Model and automatically return to the Main Menu.
  [KFSQA-602/KFSQA-570] As a KFS Chart Manager I want to add multiple account lines to the
                        Account Delegate Global using Organizational Codes because this
                        will save me time
