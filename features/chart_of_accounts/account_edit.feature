Feature: Account Edit

  [KFSQA-593] As a KFS Chart Manager, when I edit an Account with an
              invalid Sub-Fund Program Code I should get an error message presented
              at the top of the Accountant Maintenance Tab. Because the field is validated
              against a maintenance table and KFS standards require it.

  [KFSQA-610] As a KFS Chart Administrator I want to update an Account without getting a stack trace error.

  [KFSQA-632] As a KFS Fiscal Officer I need to edit an account using the Major Reporting Category Code field and enter
              a lowercase value and have it convert to UPPERCASE because I need to manage in-year financial activity,
              fund balances and year-end reporting.

  [KFSQA-586] As a KFS Chart Manager, the Account Number and the Continuation Account on that account cannot
              and should not ever be the equal as this defeats the purpose of a continuation account.

  [KFSQA-569] As a KFS Chart Manager I want to change the account expiration date
              because I still want any enroute documents to be approved.
