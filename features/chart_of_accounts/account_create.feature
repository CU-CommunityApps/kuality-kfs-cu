Feature: KFS Fiscal Officer Account Creation

  [smoke]     As a KFS Fiscal Officer I want to create an Account
              because I want to support a new project
  [KFSQA-554] Because it saves time, I as a KFS User should be able to 
              initiate an Account document with just the description.
  [KFSQA-606] As a KFS Chart User when creating an Account I should be able
              to enter data into Sub Fund Program field regardless of case
              because custom fields should behave similarly to base fields.
