Feature: Global Account

              because I need to manage in-year financial activity, fund balances and year-end reporting.
  [KFSQA-572] As a KFS Chart Manager I want create a Account Global Maintenance document with a Major Reporting Category,

              because this will save me time.
  [KFSQA-571] Summary: As a KFS Chart Manager I want create a Account Global eDoc with blank Fiscal Officer Principal Name,
              Account Supervisor Principal Name, Account Manager Name and CFDA fields because they are not required.
